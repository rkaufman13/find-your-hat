# Find Your Hat

## A node-based adventure

It's really quite simple. You, the *, have lost your hat, represented by a ^. Navigate the "maze" to find it. Don't fall into any holes!

This was done to satisfy a Codecademy exercise ostensibly about classes and modules. I also got to practice working with multidimensional arrays. Someday, I'd like to create a "maze solver" algorithm to make sure the generated boards are solvable.
